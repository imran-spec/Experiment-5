Sobel & Previtt The Sobel and Prewitt operators are both commonly used edge detection techniques in Image Processing and Computer Vision (IPCV). They work by applying filters to an image to highlight areas where there are rapid changes in intensity, like the edges of objects. The Sobel operator uses two 3x3 kernels to detect edges in both horizontal and vertical directions. Itâ€™s good at detecting edges while smoothing out noise. The Prewitt operator is similar but uses slightly different kernels. While both operators can detect edges effectively, the Sobel operator is generally preferred for its ability to handle noise better. In simple terms, these operators help in identifying the boundaries of objects in an image by emphasizing sharp intensity changes.
